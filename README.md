# origami_gcode_generator

This repository contains code for paper **Architected Vacuum Driven Origami Structures via Direct Ink Writing**. The code generates G-code files for silicone 3D printing of soft origami structures presented in the manuscript. 

The input of this software tool is a data file describing the origami crease pattern. Four pieces of data is need in the input data file:

+ Vertices' coordinates defining the origami pattern.
+ Bending hinge positions.
+ Bending information for each hinge (bending direction and angle).
+ Labels for groups of hinges requiring synchronous actuation (connected hinges).

Example input data files for basic components and demos from the manuscript are available in the example_data_files/ directory. The corresponding G-code files generated by this software tool are located in the gcode/ directory

### Download Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
Please run `main.ipynb`.
Please change the foldername and filename in the second box before running the code.
